    "Entering the movie industry is uncharted territory for Microsoft Studios. There is an opportunity for us to become profitable in this media but there is also a possibility for failure. We will be moving into a market with countless competitors and numerous established powerhouse studios. Creating films are expensive ventures and it is not enough to simply outspend our competitors. If we do not plan an effective strategy for our entry into the industry, we could potentially lose millions of dollars and our current endeavors will be all for naught.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, our process will need to be deliberate and calculated. If we focus on creating movies that movie audiences are highly interested in, there is a higher likelihood of us becoming established in this market and making money. We believe that there is insight to be had from the analysis of moviegoer trends and trying to formulate a strategy behind these trends. In this project, we postulate numerous questions and present several recommendations for our entry strategy based on the findings from our data analysis."

The metric used for measuring a genre’s success was net profit margin, a measure of total revenue over total costs. We chose to specifically look at the median profit margin for each film genre as the key metric. The reason for this is that due to the massive fluctuations between total revenue and total expenses across filmmaking in general, the mean will be greatly inflated and won’t be an accurate measurement as a baseline. It is unreasonable to start planning big budget films without first seeing if we can achieve moderate success. \n",

The reason for this is avoiding seasonality and restricting ourselves to times where we will most likely be facing stiff competition, such as the summer blockbuster time of the year. The highest profit margin we observed was by far horror movies during the year of March. Upon closer inspection, a number of extremely low budget and high grossing horror movies released in March are the cause for this. It is also important to note that October and December were observed to be low points for all these genres in terms of profitability.\n",
